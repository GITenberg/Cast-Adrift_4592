description: The river of her life, which had cut for itself a deeper channel, lay
  now so far down that it was out of the sight of common observation. Even her mother
  failed to apprehend its drift and strength. Her father knew her better. To her mother
  she was reserved and distant; to her father, warm and confiding. With the former
  she would sit for hours without speaking unless addressed; with the latter she was
  pleased and social, and grew to be interested in what interested him.
